Subject: Request for Lead Role Consideration – Summary of Contributions

Hi Rama,

As discussed, I’m writing to formally summarize the work I’ve accomplished that reflects lead-level responsibilities:
	•	10+ user stories successfully pushed to production in the past 2 months
	•	25+ internal code reviews completed, ensuring quality and consistency
	•	5+ LCM changes implemented on behalf of other team members
	•	Acting as the primary point of contact for LCM-related issues
	•	Leading onboarding/training efforts for new hires and junior team members
	•	Driving technical discussions and helping maintain coding standards across the team

I’ve taken these responsibilities on proactively because I care about the quality of our work and our success as a team. I would be grateful if this could be used to support my request for a formal move into a Lead role, with the appropriate title and compensation alignment.

Please let me know if you need any additional information to move forward with internal approvals.

Best regards,
Devin Carr
